# Ultima

**Ultima: A Comprehensive Foundation for Modern Web Applications**

The project *Ultima* is designed to be a robust, full-stack template or framework, aiming to be an "ultimata of web" development. It provides a structured environment with segregated frontend and backend components, enabling rapid development of scalable and maintainable web applications.

-----

## üöÄ Features

  * **Modular Design:** Separate frontend and backend directories for clear separation of concerns.
  * **API Integration:** A dedicated backend service built with Node.js/Express to handle business logic and data persistence.
  * **Modern User Interface:** A dynamic and responsive user interface built with a contemporary JavaScript framework. (Assumed **React.js**)
  * **Data Persistence:** Configured to connect to a flexible database system. (Assumed **MongoDB**)
  * **Scalability:** Ready for deployment and scaling, following best practices for production-grade applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Ultima is built using the following core technologies, primarily focused on JavaScript for a unified development experience across the stack:

| Component | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** | The user-facing application. (Likely using a framework like **React**). |
| **Backend** | **Node.js, Express** | The server-side environment for handling requests and routing. |
| **Database** | **MongoDB** | A NoSQL database for flexible and high-performance data storage. |

## üì¶ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need the following software installed on your machine:

  * **Node.js** (v14 or newer)
  * **npm** or **Yarn**
  * A running **MongoDB** instance (local or cloud-hosted)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shashwath63/Ultima.git
    cd Ultima
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

    Navigate to the `backend` directory and install dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables, including the database connection string:

    ```
    # Example .env content
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ultimaDB
    # Add other necessary variables (e.g., JWT_SECRET)
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory (if needed for environment variables like the API URL).

    ```
    # Example .env content for React
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

### Running the Project

1.  **Start the Backend Server** (from the `Ultima/backend` directory):

    ```bash
    npm start # or node server.js
    ```

    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Application** (from the `Ultima/frontend` directory):

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    The client application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
